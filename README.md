# Who am I and What am I Building? 🎧 🏘️

Hi 👋🏽 , welcome to my Github page!

My name is Chad and I'm a hybrid professional between **Data Science** and **Real Estate**.  With my unique background, I focus on turning *complex datasets into actionable revenue strategies*. Throughout my career, I was a part of the teams that drove more than **$1 billion in revenue** and reduced millions in operating costs by having top executives and key-decision makers as my main stakeholders.

Graduated as a **Master Student at UC Berkeley**, I am deepening my technical expertise in **business analytics**, **visualizations**, **predictive modeling** and **large-scale data pipelines**. Whether deploying investor behavior models or automating KPI tracking, I build data products that don't just report on the past, but *predict the future*.

<strong>Tools</strong> 💻: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), PyTorch, R, SQL, Spark, Javascript, and Sigma Computing to build scalable machine learning models and visualizations.
<br><br>
<strong>Interests & Languages</strong> 🗣️ | Besides data science, I have a strong love for music and the art of **DJing** 🎚️. Having spent half my life living in Vietnam, I also speak and write fluently in **Vietnamese** 🇻🇳.
